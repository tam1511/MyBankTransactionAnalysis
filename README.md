# My Bank Transaction Analysis Overview

For this funny project, I just quickly analyzed my transactions based on my own account to figure out how much I spent a month and manage my spendings habit.

# Code Use

**R studio** : ggplot package, dplyr, rmarkdown

# Data Description

The data from my own account transaction in 2 year from Sep 2020 to August 2022 

# Data Analysis

I tried to catogorize into fixed amount and variable amount and figure out how much I spent for each catogory
